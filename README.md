# Search-R1: Train your LLMs to reason and call a search engine with reinforcement learning

<!-- <strong>Search-R1</strong> is a reinforcement learning framework for <em>training reasoning and searching (tool-call) interleaved LLMs</em>.  -->
<!-- We built upon [veRL](https://github.com/volcengine/verl). -->
**Search-R1** is a reinforcement learning framework designed for training **reasoning-and-searching interleaved LLMs**—language models that learn to reason and make tool calls (e.g., to search engines) in a coordinated manner.

<!-- It can be seen as an extension of <strong>DeepSeek-R1(-Zero)</strong> with interleaved search engine calling and an opensource RL training-based solution for <strong>OpenAI DeepResearch</strong>. -->
Built upon [veRL](https://github.com/volcengine/verl), Search-R1 extends the ideas of **DeepSeek-R1(-Zero)** by incorporating interleaved search engine access and provides a fully open-source RL training pipeline. It serves as an alternative and open solution to **OpenAI DeepResearch**, enabling research and development in tool-augmented LLM reasoning.

<!-- Through RL (rule-based outcome reward), the 3B **base** LLM (both Qwen2.5-3b-base and Llama3.2-3b-base) develops reasoning and search engine calling abilities all on its own. -->

We support different RL methods (e.g., PPO, GRPO, reinforce), different LLMs (e.g., llama3, Qwen2.5, etc) and different search engines (e.g., local sparse/dense retrievers and online search engines).

## Installation

### Search-r1 environment
```bash
conda create -n searchr1 python=3.9
conda activate searchr1
# install torch [or you can skip this step and let vllm to install the correct version for you]
pip install torch==2.4.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121
# install vllm
pip3 install vllm==0.6.3 # or you can install 0.5.4, 0.4.2 and 0.3.1

# verl
pip install -e .

# flash attention 2
pip3 install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
pip install wandb
```

### Retriever environment (optional)
If you would like to call a local retriever as the search engine, you can install the environment as follows. (We recommend using a seperate environment.)
```bash
conda create -n retriever python=3.10
conda activate retriever

# we recommend installing torch with conda for faiss-gpu
conda install pytorch==2.4.0 torchvision==0.19.0 torchaudio==2.4.0 pytorch-cuda=12.1 -c pytorch -c nvidia
pip install transformers datasets pyserini

## install the gpu version faiss to guarantee efficient RL rollout
conda install -c pytorch -c nvidia faiss-gpu=1.8.0

## API function
pip install uvicorn fastapi
```


## Quick start

Train a reasoning + search LLM on NQ dataset with e5 as the retriever and wikipedia as the corpus.

(1) Download the indexing and corpus.
```bash
save_path=/the/path/to/save
python scripts/download.py --save_path $save_path
cat $save_path/part_* > $save_path/e5_Flat.index
gzip -d $save_path/wiki-18.jsonl.gz
```

(2) Process the NQ dataset.
```bash
python scripts/data_process/nq_search.py
```

(3) Launch a local retrieval server.
```bash
conda activate retriever
bash retrieval_launch.sh
```

(4) Run RL training (PPO) with Llama-3.2-3b-base.
```bash
conda activate searchr1
bash train_ppo.sh
```

## Preliminary results

(1) The base model (llama3.2-3b-base) learns to call the search engine and obtain improved performance.

(2) The base model (Qwen2.5-7b-base) can learn to conduct multi-turn search engine calling and reasoning with RL.

## Inference
#### You can play with the trained Search-R1 model with your own question.
(1) Launch a local retrieval server.
```bash
conda activate retriever
bash retrieval_launch.sh
```

(2) Run inference.
```bash
conda activate searchr1
python infer.py
```
You can modify the ```question``` on line 7 to something you're interested in.

## Use your own dataset

### QA data
For each question-answer sample, it should be a dictionary containing the desired content as below:

```
data = {
        "data_source": data_source,
        "prompt": [{
            "role": "user",
            "content": question,
        }],
        "ability": "fact-reasoning",
        "reward_model": {
            "style": "rule",
            "ground_truth": solution
        },
        "extra_info": {
            'split': split,
            'index': idx,
        }
    }
```

You can refer to ```scripts/data_process/nq_search.py``` for a concrete data processing example.

### Corpora

It is recommended to make your corpus a jsonl file, where each line (a dictionary with "id" key and "contents" key) corresponds to one passage. You can refer to ```example/corpus.jsonl``` for an example.

The "id" key corresponds to the passage id, while the "contents" key corresponds to the passage content.
For example:
```
{"id": "0", "contents": "Evan Morris Evan L. Morris (January 26, 1977 \u2013 July 9, 2015) was a lobbyist for Genentech and its parent corporation Roche in Washington."}
...
{"id": "100", "contents": "Three years later, when the United States Exploring Expedition to little-known portions of the globe was organised under Charles Wilkes, Hale was recommended, while yet an undergraduate."}
...
```

**Index your corpora (optional).**
If you would like to use a local retriever as the search engine, you can index your own corpus by:
```
bash search_r1/search/build_index.sh
```
You can change ```retriever_name``` and ```retriever_model``` to your interested off-the-shelf retriever.

## Use your own search engine

Our codebase supports local sparse retriever (e.g., BM25), local dense retriever (both flat indexing with GPUs and ANN indexing with CPUs) and online search engine (e.g., Google, Bing, etc). More details can be found [here](https://github.com/PeterGriffinJin/Search-R1/tree/main/docs/retriever.md).

The main philosophy is to launch a local or remote search engine server separately from the main RL training pipeline. 

The LLM can call the search engine by calling the search API (e.g., "http://127.0.0.1:8000/retrieve").

You can refer to ```search_r1/search/retriever_server.py``` for an example of launching a local retriever server.
